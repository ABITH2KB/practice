# Kubernetes Practice Folder

This folder contains basic Kubernetes resources you can apply and modify as you learn:

## Files Included
- deployment.yaml — Basic Deployment
- service.yaml — Service for the Deployment
- configmap.yaml — ConfigMap example
- namespace.yaml — Namespace example

## How to Use
Apply all files:

Modify these files as you learn more (Probes, Secrets, Ingress, Volumes, Autoscaling…)
